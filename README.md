Hi! I’m Raymond Baker, an undergraduate mathematics student at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
I’m interested in homotopy type theory and the univalent foundations of mathematics, higher category theory, and (constructive) logic. I am fascinated by the connections between these subjects and computation.

For contact information or more details about my interests, please see [my website](https://morphismz.github.io/).
