Hi, I’m Raymond Baker, a mathematics student at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
I’m interested in categorical mathematics, the foundations of math, and, consequently, univalent approaches to mathematics.  
I’m currently learning higher order categorical logic, the calculus of inductive constructions, and how to use proof assitants (primarily Coq).
