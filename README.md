Hi, I’m Raymond Baker, an undergraduate mathematics student at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
I’m interested in homotopy type theory and the univalent foundations of mathematics, higher category theory, and (constructive) logic. I am fascinated by the connections between these subjects and computation.

I’m currently writing a senior thesis on Eckmann-Hilton and the hopf fibration in homotopy type theory. I aim to write out a proof in the language of HoTT that we can construct a generator of pi3(S2) with Eckmann-Hilton. Time permitting, some related code my show up on git-hub!
